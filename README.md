# RTL-GNSS

This is a example of gnss spoofing attack and data colletction.

We applied RTL-SDR, HackRF One and GPS antenna as the RF front end and transmitter.

HackRF One transmits fake GPS L1 C/A signal generated by the open-source software GPS-SDR-SIM (https://github.com/osqzss/gpssdr-sim)

then GNSS-SDR software (https://gnss-sdr.org/) and RTL-SDR are used to record data in L1 channel (1575.42 MHz).

Extract the zip locally and run extract_rtl_data.m on MATLAB to extract the data.
